# Globalisation
## Starter

**My definition of Globalisation**: Globalisation is the global flow (and spread) of products, ideas, cultures and peoples.
**Official Definition**: Globalisation describes a process by which national and regional economies, societies and cultures have become integrated through the global network of trade, communication, immigration and transportation.

## Types of Globalisation

 * **Economic**: Countries that trade with many others and have few trade barriers are economically globalised.
 * **Social**: A measure of how easily information and ideas pass between people in their own country and between different countries (includes access to internet and social media networks).
 * **Political**: The amount of political co-operation there is between countries.

## Why is Globalisation Accelerating

 * **Connections are lengthening** - new links between places that are greater apart.
 * **Connections are faster** - Faster speed of connections with people about to talk to one another in real time or travelling quickly between continents.
 * **Connections are deepening** - More people's lives connect with far away places - eg. purchasing commodities / cheaper travel. Not just rich people who 'live globally'
